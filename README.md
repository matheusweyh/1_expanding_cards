# 1_expanding_cards

This is the first of the "50 Projects in 50 Days" course by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop.
The one created on default is using images of places like forests, mountains, beaches and cities. 
I decided to mix things up a little bit and made a top 5 film card (my top 5 movies are always changing and these were the ones stuck in my head the moment I
was making the project)
